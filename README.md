# 🧠 Offline Voice Assistant — "Nova"

Nova is an **offline voice-controlled assistant** built in Python using the [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) speech recognition toolkit. It listens for a wake word, recognizes natural commands, and responds using text-to-speech — all without an internet connection.

## 🌟 Features

- 🎙️ Wake-word activation: "Hey Nova", "Nova", or "Wakeup Nova"
- 🎛️ Device control: Light, Fan, Door, Bulb, and All Devices (simulated)
- 🔁 Wake/Sleep toggle with “Goodbye”
- 🕒 Real-time clock reporting
- ❤️ Friendly conversation (“I love you”, “You are beautiful”, etc.)
- 🔇 Self-suppression: Doesn’t listen while speaking (avoids feedback)
- 🧠 Fully offline — privacy-respecting and fast

-  Say any of the following:

    "Hey Nova"
      "Nova"
    "Wakeup Nova"

-To deactivate or put the assistant to sleep:
     "Good buy"
